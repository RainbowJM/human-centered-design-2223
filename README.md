## User Needs
### Who
Nicolette is a 76-year-old woman. Nicolette has limited use of her limbs, she can partially use her arm and legs. 
She uses a wheelchair to get around. She is trained geologist, and really love topics about climate change and nature. 
She worked at municipality of Amsterdam, where she organized many activities for disabled people.

### What
Nicolette has a laptop where she stores a lot of documents. 
To operate her laptop she uses a drawing tablet Wacom Intuos S and Dragon a speech software. 
She uses her drawing tablet as a mouse where she can click on elements. 
Because she has more control when she uses the pen. Furthermore, she uses the speech software as an alternative to the keyboard. 
She can type but not as fast, can press a key one by one. 
So Nicolette can operate her laptop on her own, but she would like to find an easier way to want to select, copy and paste important piece of text.

### How
This will be accomplished by using the user (Nicolette) will be able to copy and paste, this will be accomplished by using the web speech API.

## Tests
### Round 1
For the first test I created a prototype based on the informations that we got from the assignment (without knowing her).
During the first test it was important to get to know Nicolette a little bit more.
By asking her a few questions.
Questions:
1. Can you tell us a little about yourself?
2. What do you do on the computer?
3. What can you do with your tablet?
4. How do you experience computer control with speech?
5. What kind of tablet do you have?
6. What settings have you set up on your tablet?
7. How do you paste and paste on the browser?
8. What are your limitations with the drawing tablet?
9. What do you still want to be able to do?
10. Why do you use tablet and not the mouse?

After the introduction round, was the round were Nicolette could try the first version of the prototype. 

Version one of the prototype you can find it in the following branch: [Version 1](https://github.com/RainbowJM/human-centered-design-2223/tree/v1)
