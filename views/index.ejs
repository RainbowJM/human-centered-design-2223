            <p>The rental housing market in the Netherlands is divided into social housing and private sector rentals.
                The rental category depends on the characteristics of the residence. If the rental value according to
                those characteristics does not exceed the threshold, the rent is regulated. Above that rental price,
                rent is not controlled.</p>
